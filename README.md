- A clear description of the problem or suggestion.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Expected and actual behavior (if applicable).
- Any error messages, if relevant.

#### 2. Submitting Code 🖥️
If you want to contribute code, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this repository's page to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**  
   After forking, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scripting-With-JavaScript.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**  
   Always create a new branch for your changes. This helps keep the `main` branch clean and makes it easier to review your changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name

44. **Make your changes**  
   Now, make the necessary changes or additions to the codebase.

5. **Commit your changes**  
   Once you've made your changes, commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature/bug fix description"
   ```

6. **Push your changes**  
   Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**  
   Once your changes are pushed, go to your repository on GitHub and click **Compare & pull request**. Describe the changes you made and why you think they should be merged.

#### 3. Code Style and Guidelines ⚙️

To maintain consistency throughout the codebase, please follow these guidelines when writing code:

- **Use proper indentation**: 2 spaces per indentation level.
- **Write descriptive commit messages**: Each commit message should describe what was changed and why.
- **Follow best practices for JavaScript**:  
  - Use `const` or `let` for variable declarations, and avoid using `var`.
  - Use arrow functions (`() => {}`) when possible.
  - Use template literals for string concatenation (`${variable}`).
  - Always add a space after `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.

#### 4. Tests 🧪
If you add new features or fix bugs, please include **tests** for your changes. This helps ensure the project stays robust and doesn't break with new changes. If possible, add tests that cover edge cases.

#### 5. Documentation 📚
Make sure to update any relevant documentation in the `README.md` or any other files when making changes or adding new features. This helps users understand how to use the project and keeps the project well-documented.
