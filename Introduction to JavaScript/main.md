# What is Programming
The Art of Telling Computers What to Do!
Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) for a computer to execute specific tasks. These instructions are written using programming languages like C, JavaScript, Python, and more.

# Why Do We Need Programming
Programming is used to create software, websites, apps, games, and even control robots! It allows us to:
- âœ… Automate tasks
- âœ… Solve problems efficiently
- âœ… Build interactive applications

# ECMAScript
ECMAScript: The Standard Behind JavaScript
ECMAScript (ES) is the standard that defines the rules and guidelines for scripting languages like JavaScript. Think of it as a blueprint or set of specifications that ensure consistent behavior across different programming environments (like browsers or servers).

ðŸ¤” How is ECMAScript Related to JavaScript?
JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript.
Other languages like JScript and ActionScript are also based on ECMAScript.
<br>ðŸ§© What Does ECMAScript Define?
<br>ECMAScript outlines things like: - Syntax: How code should be written (e.g., keywords, structure).
- Types: How different data types work (e.g., strings, numbers).
- Functions & Objects: How functions and objects should behave.
- Execution: The rules for how code should be run.

# How to Execute JavaScript
## 1. In the Browser Console
How to Execute:
Open the browser.
Press F12 (or right-click â†’ "Inspect").
Go to the Console tab.
Type your JavaScript code and press Enter.

```javascript
// Example:
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## 2. In an HTML File
How to Execute:
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html).
Write JavaScript inside <script> tags.
Open the HTML file in a browser.

```html
// Example:
<html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <script>
      console.log("JavaScript in HTML!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 3. Using Node.js (Outside Browser)
How to Execute:
Install Node.js.
Create a .js file (e.g., app.js).
Open terminal/command prompt.
Run node app.js.
```javascript
// Example (app.js):
console.log("Hello from Node.js!");
```
